          <p>
            I am an Integrated Learning Therapy practitioner and a qualified
            Foundation Phase teacher. I have an Honours degree in Psychology and
            10 years of Grade R-3 teaching experience. I use a holistic approach
            to develop individualised, multisensory remedial intervention. I
            work with children of all ages and I specialise in learning
            readiness, inattention, hyperactivity, sensory processing
            difficulties, dyslexia, and other literacy difficulties.</p>
